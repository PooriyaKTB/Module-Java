 * Streams
 * =======================
 * <p>
 * Time to venture into the world of functional programming and try using some Streams.
 * <p>
 * Let's go... Have a go at solving the following exercises first using loops, and then convert them to use streams. As you work through, think about how the two approaches compare in terms of readability, how easy the code would be to adapt in future (as we know in enterprise software, code never stays the same forever as new requirements and bugs are worked on!), and compare the trade-offs in efficiency.
